# A little taste of some skills learned at "Data Analytics" bootcamp

## Overview
The objective of the project is to walkthrough on some of the main skills learned at "Data
Analytics" bootcamp, through the world of Marvel Comics.

* 1. ETL (Marvel Api and datasets downloaded from kaggle)
* 2. Data Visualization
* 3. Machine Learning Model
    * Model Selection
    * Feature Engineering
    * Model Training
    * Model Evaluation
    * Model Prediction
    * Model Validation

## ETL
In this section we will use ETL to extract data from the Marvel API, make some transformations
and show the results in a web page. we'll use the followings techniques:
* Data Acquisition (Api request)
* Data Cleaning
* Data Loading

Also We'll download the dataset "Marvel Superheros" published in kaggle in the following link:
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dannielr/marvel-superheroes"
    target="_blank">kaggle-marvel-superheros</a>
At the end we'll define 2 datasets, 1 for training and 1 for predictions,
The first has 344 rows and 14 variables, while the second has 166 rows and 14 variables.

## Data Visualization
Data Visualization is the process of better understanding the data using graphics and charts,
has the power to tell data-driven stories while allowing people to see patterns and relationships
found in data.

In this section we will create and interpret different types of visualizations to better understand
datasets we are working with.

## Machine Learning Model
Supervised ML model
In this section we will implement step-by-step a machine learning model to predict whether the
characters in the target dataset are aligned to good or bad.
