      <h5 class="title">Conclusion</h5>
      <p class="bd-lead">
        In the development of the machine learning model we were able to observe how it is possible to generate a series
        of consecutive steps that can be automated allowing to run the process for different models by changing only the
        source datasets.
      </p>
      <h5 class="title">Next steps:</h5>
      <ol class="bd-lead">
        <li> Develop generic functions that allow solving to return results regardless of the source dataset.</li>
        <li> Implement this type of functions to more machine learning models such as linear regression, decision
          trees, Clustering, etc. </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="bd-lead">that's how much, thanks.</p>
