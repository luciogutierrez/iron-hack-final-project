      <p class="bd-lead">
        It's possible to generate pipelines that allows to implement machine learning models in a generic way. I mean, the same pipeline can be used for different datasets by making small adjustments to the generic functions.      </p>
      <div class="title2">Next steps</div>
      <ol class="bd-lead">
        <li> Implement this type of functions to more machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision
          Trees, Clustering, etc. </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="bd-lead">That's how much, thanks for your attention.</p>
