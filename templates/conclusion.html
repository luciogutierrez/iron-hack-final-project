        <li>The machine learning models can be implemented in almost any subject area.</li>
        <li>There are many methods for collecting data.</li>
        <li>We must dedicate a lot of time to look and understand the data and how the variables are related to each other.</li>
        <li>Develop machine learning models is not a simple task, but we can define a roadmap to help us implement it.</li>
