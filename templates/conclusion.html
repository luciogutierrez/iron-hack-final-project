      <h5 class="title">Conclusion</h5>
      <p class="bd-lead">
        It is possible to generate a pipeline that allows implementing machine learning models in a generic way, I mean,
        the same pipeline can be used for any dataset by making small adjustments to the generic functions.
      </p>
      <h5 class="title">Next steps:</h5>
      <ol class="bd-lead">
        <li> Implement this type of functions to more machine learning models such as linear regression, decision
          trees, Clustering, etc. </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="bd-lead">that's how much, thanks so much for your attention.</p>
