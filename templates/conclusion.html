        It is possible to generate pipelines that allows to implement machine learning models in a generic way. I mean,
        the same pipeline can be used for different datasets for specific machine learning model by making small adjustments to
        the generic functions.
      </p>
      <div class="title2">Next steps</div>
      <ol class="bd-lead">
        <li> Implement this type of functions to more machine learning models such as linear regression, decision
          trees, Clustering, etc. </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="bd-lead">that's how much, thanks for your attention.</p>
