            <h1 class="display-6">
                Ironhack has provided us with a very important toolkit that we can use when working with ML models.
                In my case, I went from not having tools, to have a lot and not knowing which ones to use.
                <br /><br />
                The objective of the project is to walk, step by step through the different processes involved in the
                generation
                of a machine learning model:

            <h3 class="title">ETL</h3>
            <h1 class="display-6">
                In this section we will use ETL to extract data from the marvel Api,
                make some transformations and show the results in a web page. we'll use the followings techniques:
                <ul class="paragraph">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data Acquisition (Api request)</li>
                        <li>Data Cleaning</li>
                        <li>Feature Engineering</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <br />
                Also We'll download the dataset "Marvel characters" published in kaggle in the following link:
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dannielr/marvel-superheroes"
                    target="_blank">kaggle-marvel-characters</a>
                <br />
                <br />
                At the end we'll define 2 datasets, 1 for training and 1 for predictions. the first has 344 rows and 14
                variables, while the second has 166 rows and 14 variables.

            <h3 class="title">Data Visualization</h3>
            <h1 class="display-6">
                Data Visualization is the process of better understanding the data using graphics and charts,
                has the power to tell data-driven stories while allowing people to see patterns and relationships
                found in data.
                <br /><br />
                In this section we will create and interpret different types of visualizations to better
                understand the datases we are working with.

                In this section we will implement a Logistic Regression model to predict whether the
                characters' alignment of second dataset are good or bad.
