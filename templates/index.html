            <h1 class="display-6">
                Ironhack has provided us with a very important toolkit that we can use when working with ML models.
                In my personal case, I went from not having tools, to have a lot and not knowing which ones to use.
                </br>
                The objective of the project is to walk through the different processes involved in the generation
                of a machine learning model explaining what happened in each of them.
                </br></br>
                The main ML procces could be as follow:
                <ol class="paragraph">
                    <li>Extraction, Transformation, Loading (ETL)</li>
                    <li>Data Visualization</li>
                    <li>Model Selection</li>
                    <li>Model Training / Prediction</li>
                    <li>Model Validation</li>
                </ol>
            </h1>

            <h3 class="title">ETL</h3>
            <h1 class="display-6">
                In this section we will use the three stages of ETL to extract data from the marvel Api,
                make some transformations and show the results in a web page.
                <ol class="paragraph">
                    <li>ETL</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data Acquisition (Api request)</li>
                        <li>Data Cleaning</li>
                        <li>Feature Engineering</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <br />
                We'll use the dataset "Marvel Superheros" published in kaggle in the following link:
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dannielr/marvel-superheroes"
                    target="_blank">kaggle-marvel-characters</a>
                <br />
                <br />
                In fact the source contains 8 datasets so the first task we had
                to do was to analyze the content of each one and define the data we
                would use for our project.

            <h3 class="title">Data Visualization</h3>
            <h1 class="display-6">
                Data Visualization is the process of better understand the data using graphics and charts,
                has the power to tell data-driven stories while allowing people to see patterns and relationships
                found in data.
                <br><br>
                In this section we will create and interpret different types of visualizations to better
                understand the datases we are working with.

                In this section we will implement a Logistic Regression model to predict whether the
                alignment of second dataset characters are good or bad.
                <br>
                But... what is Logistic Regression?, Logistic regression is a classification technique that gives
                the probabilistic output of dependent categorical value based on certain independent variables,
                which the output is considered as 1 and below the threshold, the output is considered as 0.
