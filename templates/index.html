        <h2 style="color:blue">Marvel Superheros Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The project's goal is to show the knowledge acquired along Data Analysys bootcamp given by Ironhack Mexico.
            </br>
            We chosed Marvel's Superheroes theme as it has the necessary elements to help work on the 4 topics we will
            cover in this project:
        <ol>
            <li>Api Requests</li>
            <li>Data Visualization</li>
            <li>Supervised Machine Learning model</li>
            <li>Unsupervised Machine Learning model</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry-content">
        <h3 style="color:blue">Api Requests</h3>
        <p>
            In this section we will use python "requests" method to connect to the Marvel Api.
            </br>
            We will download information of our favorite super heroes which we will use to generate
            an online catalog to access the web page of each one of them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry-content">
        <h3 style="color:blue">Data Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            In this section we will create and interpret different types of visualizations to better understand the Marvel dataset we are working with.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry-content">
        <h3 style="color:blue">Supervised Machine Learning model</h3>
        <p>
            In this section we will work on a supervised learning model to predict whether the alignment of a superhero is good or evil.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry-content">
        <h3 style="color:blue">Unsupervised Machine Learning model</h3>
        <p>
            In this section we will work on a unsupervised learning model to classify superheros in diferent groups according to their main features.
        </p>
